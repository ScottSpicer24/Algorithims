# Algorithims
A few of the programs for Princeton's free DSA course. 
Before I finished I went back to university so I stopped but the assignments for the first couple of weeks are here.<br>
**Week 1:** *Percolation.* Union-find and alg analysis.<br>
**Week 2:** *Deque, DequeSlow, RandomizedQueue.* Stacks and queues, basic sorts.<br>
