 The model. 
 We model a percolation system using an n-by-n grid of sites. 
 Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is an open site that can be 
 connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring 
 (left, right, up, down) open sites. We say the system percolates if there is a 
 full site in the bottom row. In other words, a system percolates if we 
 fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open
 site on the bottom row. (For the insulating/metallic materials example, 
 the open sites correspond to metallic materials, so that a system that 
 percolates has a metallic path from top to bottom, with full sites conducting. 
 For the porous substance example, the open sites correspond to empty space 
 through which water might flow, so that a system that percolates 
 lets water fill open sites, flowing from top to bottom.)

 The problem. 
 In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following 
 question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p 
 (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), 
 what is the probability that the system percolates?
 When n is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* such that 
 when p < p* a random n-by-n grid almost never percolates, and when p > p*, 
 a random n-by-n grid almost always percolates. No mathematical solution for 
 \determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived. 
 Your task is to write a computer program to estimate p*.
